  <p>
    Veusz is a scientific plotting and graphing program with a
    graphical user interface, designed to produce publication-ready
    2D and <a href="/3d/">3D</a> plots.

    In addition it can be used as a module in Python for plotting.

    Veusz is multiplatform, running on Windows, Linux/Unix and macOS.

    It supports vector and bitmap output, including PDF, Postscript,
    SVG and EMF.

    Veusz is <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free
    Software</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    With the help of a tutorial the program can be used by the novice
    user and is flexible for advanced work.

    In Veusz plots are created by building up plotting widgets with a
    consistent object-based interface, where the user sets the
    properties of the widgets.

    There are many options for customization of
    plots. See <a href="/features/">features</a>, <a href="/examples/">2D
    examples</a> and <a href="/examples3d/">3D examples</a> to see
    what can be done with the program.
  </p>

  <p>
    It allows data to be imported from text, CSV, HDF5 and FITS files.

    Datasets can also be entered within the program and new datasets
    can be created via the manipulation of existing datasets using
    mathematical expressions and more.

    The program can also be extended, by adding plugins supporting
    importing new data formats, different types of data manipulation
    or for automating tasks.
