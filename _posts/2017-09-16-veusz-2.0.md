Released Veusz 2.0. Veusz has been updated to use Qt5 and PyQt5. As Qt5 has dropped Postscript support, Veusz now uses Ghostscript (if installed) to export to PS and EPS formats. The instruction manual has been converted to be generated with Sphinx and reStructured Text. The deprecated veusz_listen script has been dropped in favour of "veusz --listen". The Windows build now requires Windows 7, while the Mac build requires 10.10. The Linux binary now uses xz compression. All binaries have been upgrade to use Python 3. A source build fix for FreeBSD is also included.

Please see the [release notes](/releasenotes/2.0.txt).
