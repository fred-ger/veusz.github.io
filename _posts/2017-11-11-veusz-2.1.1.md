This is a bug fix release. It fixes the error when exporting a plot with dotted/dashed lines to EMF format. The errors when using dataset, tools or import plugins are solved. The command line argument handling has been rewritten, fixing an encoding issue in Windows where some filenames (e.g. Chinese) would not open when double-clicked. The splash screen now is hidden after a time period, so it does not obscure dialog boxes. Code to use the deprecated sipconfig if possible when building to get details of the SIP installation has been reintroduced.


Please see the [release notes](/releasenotes/2.1.1.txt).
