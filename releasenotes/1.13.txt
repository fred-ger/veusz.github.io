Veusz is a Qt4 based scientific plotting package. It is written in
Python, using PyQt4 for display and user-interfaces, and numpy for
handling the numeric data. Veusz is designed to produce
publication-ready Postscript/PDF/SVG output. The user interface aims
to be simple, consistent and powerful.

Veusz provides a GUI, command line, embedding and scripting interface
(based on Python) to its plotting facilities. It also allows for
manipulation and editing of datasets. Data can be captured from
external sources such as internet sockets or other programs.

Changes in 1.13:
 * Graphs are rendered in separate threads for speed and a responsive
   user interface
 * A changed Graph is rendered immediately on document modification,
   improving latency
 * A new ternary plot widget is included
 * Size of pages can be modified individually in a document
 * Binary data import added
 * NPY/NPZ numpy data import added
 * Axis and tick labels on axes can be rotated at 45 deg intervals
 * Labels can be plotted next to points on non-orthogonal plots
 * Add an option for DPI of output EPS and PDF files

Minor improvements:
 * Import dialog detects filename extension to show correct tab
 * Polygon fill mode for non orthogonal plotting
 * --plugin command line option added, for loading and testing plugins
 * Plugin for swapping two colors in a plot
 * Dataset navigator is moved to right of window by default
 * Mac OS X binary release updated to Python 2.7.2
 * Import plugins can say which file extensions they support
 * Import plugins can be "promoted" to their own tab on the import dialog
 * ForceUpdate command added to embedding API, to force an update of
   the displayed plot (useful if SetUpdateInterval is set to 0)
 * X or Y dataset can be left blank in plotter to plot by row number

Bugs fixed:
 * Images plotted when axes are inverted are inverted too
 * Fixed crash when selecting datasets for plotting in the popup menu
 * Picker crashes with a constant function
 * 2D dataset creation using expressions fixed
 * CSV reader treated dataset names ending in + or - incorrectly
 * unique1d function no longer available in numpy

Features of package:
 * X-Y plots (with errorbars)
 * Line and function plots
 * Contour plots
 * Images (with colour mappings and colorbars)
 * Stepped plots (for histograms)
 * Bar graphs
 * Vector field plots
 * Box plots
 * Polar plots
 * Ternary plots
 * Plotting dates
 * Fitting functions to data
 * Stacked plots and arrays of plots
 * Plot keys
 * Plot labels
 * Shapes and arrows on plots
 * LaTeX-like formatting for text
 * EPS/PDF/PNG/SVG/EMF export
 * Scripting interface
 * Dataset creation/manipulation
 * Embed Veusz within other programs
 * Text, CSV, FITS, NPY/NPZ, QDP, binary and user-plugin importing
 * Data can be captured from external sources
 * User defined functions, constants and can import external Python functions
 * Plugin interface to allow user to write or load code to
    - import data using new formats
    - make new datasets, optionally linked to existing datasets
    - arbitrarily manipulate the document
 * Data picker
 * Multithreaded rendering

Requirements for source install:
 Python (2.4 or greater required)
   http://www.python.org/
 Qt >= 4.3 (free edition)
   http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/  
 PyQt >= 4.3 (SIP is required to be installed first)
   http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/
   http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/sip/
 numpy >= 1.0
   http://numpy.scipy.org/

Optional:
 Microsoft Core Fonts (recommended for nice output)
   http://corefonts.sourceforge.net/
 PyFITS >= 1.1 (optional for FITS import)
   http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/pyfits
 pyemf >= 2.0.0 (optional for EMF export)
   http://pyemf.sourceforge.net/
 PyMinuit >= 1.1.2 (optional improved fitting)
   http://code.google.com/p/pyminuit/
 For EMF and better SVG export, PyQt >= 4.6 or better is
   required, to fix a bug in the C++ wrapping
   

For documentation on using Veusz, see the "Documents" directory. The
manual is in PDF, HTML and text format (generated from docbook). The
examples are also useful documentation. Please also see and contribute
to the Veusz wiki: http://barmag.net/veusz-wiki/

Issues with the current version:

 * Some recent versions of PyQt/SIP will causes crashes when exporting
   SVG files. Update to 4.7.4 (if released) or a recent snapshot to
   solve this problem.
