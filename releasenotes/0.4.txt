Veusz is a scientific plotting package written in Python (currently
100% Python). It uses PyQt for display and user-interfaces, and
numarray for handling the numeric data. Veusz is designed to produce
publication-ready Postscript output.

Veusz provides a GUI, command line and scripting interface (based on
Python) to its plotting facilities. The plots are built using an
object-based system to provide a consistent interface.

Currently done:
 * X-Y plots (with errorbars)
 * Stepped plots (for histograms)
 * Line plots
 * Function plots
 * Stacked plots and arrays of plots
 * Plot keys
 * Plot labels
 * LaTeX-like formatting for text
 * EPS output
 * Simple data importing
 * Scripting interface
 * Save/Load plots
 * Some work on a manual and introduction

To be done:
 * Contour plots
 * Images
 * Filled regions
 * UI improvements
 * Import filters (for qdp and other plotting packages, fits, csv)
 * Data manipulation
 * Python embedding interface (for embedding Veusz in other programs).
   [some of the external interface is complete]
 * Proper installation program

Requirements:
