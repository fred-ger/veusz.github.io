Bugs fixed:
 * Images plotted when axes are inverted are inverted too

   delete or unlink all associated datasets
 * New tree-like dataset browsing widget is shown in data edit dialog
 * Importing 1D fits images is now supported
 * Date / time data has its own dataset type
 * The data edit dialog box can create or edit date/time data in
   human-readable form

Minor improvements:
 * Add LaTeX commands \cdot, \nabla, \overline plus some arrows
 * Inform user in exception dialog if a new version is available
 * Add linevertbar and linehorzbar error bar styles

Bug fixes:
 * Fix crash on filling filled error regions if no error bars
 * Remove grouping separator to numbers in locale as it creates
   ambiguous lists of numbers

 * Combo boxes are now case sensitive when displaying matches with
   previous text
 * Fix errors if plotting DatasetRange or Dataset1DPlugin datasets
   against data with nan values
 * Fix division by zero in dataset preview
 * Do not leave settings pointing to deleted widgets after an undo
 * Fix errors when using super/subscripts of super/subscripts
 * Fix crash when giving positions of bar plot and labels
 * Do not allow dataset names to be invalid after remaining

   and not connecting points making curves
 * Stop crash when contouring zero-sized datasets

Changes in 1.11:
 * New data point picker for finding coordinates of points on plot
   (contributed by B.K. Stuhl)
 * New data navigator window for filtering, sorting and examining
   dataset statistics
 * ".." button next to dataset settings pops up data navigator for
   choosing datasets
 * Data fitting can now use PyMinuit, giving error estimates
   (B.K. Stuhl)
 * Console history now uses currently entered characters to select
   lines from history (B.K. Stuhl)
