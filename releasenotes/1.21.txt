Veusz 1.21
----------
http://home.gna.org/veusz/

Veusz is a scientific plotting package.  It is designed to produce
publication-ready Postscript, PDF or SVG output. Graphs are built-up
by combining plotting widgets. The user interface aims to be simple,
consistent and powerful.

Veusz provides GUI, Python module, command line, scripting, DBUS and
SAMP interfaces to its plotting facilities. It also allows for
manipulation and editing of datasets. Data can be captured from
external sources such as Internet sockets or other programs.

Changes in 1.21:
 * Add HDF5 saved document format
 * Add filled curve error bar style
 * Add fill left/right options for point plotter
 * Add filetype filters to import dialog file browser dialog
 * In file completer in import dialog, use selected tab as filter
 * Move code to use PyQt new style signals
 * Add a master color setting for xy point and nonorthpoint plot
 * Line labelling algorithm much improved in contour plots, which
   rotates text to match line angle and avoids label overlaps
 * More accurate axis tick label bounding boxes, allowing rotated
   labels to be placed close together
 * Add reflection and rotation options to vector field widget
 * Switch to scientific notation earlier when showing float settings

Bug fixes:
 * Direction combo did not work in import dialog
 * Saving text datasets did not work in Python3
 * Fix partial dataset evaluation issue when loading documents
 * 2D non-regular pixel spaced images give error if clipped in y
 * Handle Unicode quoted characters in simple text data files
 * xcent/ycent in Dataset2D import plugins were ignored
 * promote_tab broken for import plugins
 * Full screen view when all pages are deleted
 * Crash with empty dataset and boxplot widget
 * Fix copy and paste of datasets
 * Python 3 resizing axis bug
 * Crash if picking/zooming on document with no pages
 * Crash if reediting histogram dataset with blank output entry
 * Use end of text formatting string beyond format specifier
 * When writing SVG text as text, use xml:space="preserve" to
   avoid missing whitespace
 * Embedding socket issue on Python 3.4+

Issues with the current version:

  * Due to a bug in the Qt XML processing, some MathML elements
    containing purely white space (e.g. thin space) will give an error.
