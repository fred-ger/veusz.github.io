Veusz 1.22
----------
http://home.gna.org/veusz/

Veusz is a scientific plotting package.  It is designed to produce
publication-ready Postscript, PDF or SVG output. Graphs are built-up
by combining plotting widgets. The user interface aims to be simple,
consistent and powerful.

Veusz provides GUI, Python module, command line, scripting, DBUS and
SAMP interfaces to its plotting facilities. It also allows for
manipulation and editing of datasets. Data can be captured from
external sources such as Internet sockets or other programs.

Changes in 1.22:
 * Add option to ignore white space following delimiters when importing CSVs
 * Allow x/yedge and x/ycent to be inverted to change data order
   when import 2D data
 * Rewrite of widget tree internals to fix miscellaneous bugs
 * Optionally use astropy for SAMP
 * Add setting to extend the python import path
 * Add option to select widgets with same name on page
 * Resize rectangular shapes keeping other corners fixed. Old symmetric
   resize behaviour is retained if shift is pressed.

Bug fixes
 * Fix faulty caching of datasets expressions
 * Do not auto mirror axes if shared axis placed in grid and ignore
   other hidden axes for mirroring purposes
 * gridatedge 2D import option inverts values in rows
 * y values for 2D datasets in data edit dialog are inverted
 * Fix crash when constructing 2D dataset with constants
 * Fix crash when interpreting date values with unicode
 * Fix for crash when moving ellipses on broken axes
 * Fix crash when editing datetime data
 * Fix crash when renaming 2D datasets in dataset editor
 * If 2d dataset does not exist, don't crash when using colorbar
 * Ignore HDF5 data types which are not supported by h5py
 * Catch recursion limit errors properly
 * In sort and text sort plugins, clip length to minimum
 * Do not plot functions with more than 1D in function plotter
 * Catch error for shapes widgets with no coordinates
 * Handle zero length datasets in subtract minimum or mean
 * Clip range of zoom between 0.05 and 20x
 * Catch errors in CSV date format
 * Do not allow 2D datasets to be used for labels in label widget
 * Handle unicode data correctly in clipboard data
 * Fix data import dialog for fits files in unicode paths

Issues with the current version:

  * Due to a bug in the Qt XML processing, some MathML elements
    containing purely white space (e.g. thin space) will give an error.
