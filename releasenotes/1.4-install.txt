Veusz Installation
==================

Veusz uses distutils for its installation. See below for how to use
it.

Requirements:
 python >= 2.3   http://www.python.org/
 PyQt >= 4.3     http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/
 numpy >= 1.0    http://numpy.scipy.org/

(PyQt requires
 Qt4             http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/ (free version)
                 version >= 4.2.2 recommended
 SIP             http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/sip/   )

Optional requirements:
 PyFITS>=1.1     http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/pyfits

 Veusz works much better with Microsoft's corefonts installed (or other good
 TrueType fonts). 
  see            http://corefonts.sourceforge.net/

Simple source use (if requirements installed)
=============================================
If you don't want to bother installing veusz fully, it can be run from
its own directory (at the moment). Simply do:

# tar xzf veusz-1.2.1.tar.gz                [change version here]
# cd veusz-1.2.1
# ./veusz_main.py

However certain features (currently contours) require C modules to be
built. Currently only contour support requires this. You can build
this without installing by doing:

# python setup.py build
# cp build/*/veusz/helpers/*.so helpers/

Full installation with distutils
================================
There are a number of ways to install programs using distutils. I will
list a few of the possible method here:

To install to the standard location on the hard disk (it's better to use
rpms if you have an rpm-based linux distibution)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
# cd veusz-1.2.1
# python setup.py build
# su
[enter root password]
# python setup.py install 
# exit

Linux binary
============
If you do not have the requirements, you can use the Linux binary
instead (if available). Note that this may not work on all
distributions due to glibc/library incompatibilities. You need to
simply unpack the tar file and run the main executable:

# tar xzf veusz-linux-i386-1.2.1.tar.gz     [change version here]
# cd veusz-linux-i386-1.2.1
# ./veusz

Installing in Windows
=====================
Simply run the setup.exe binary installer. This does not provide the
embedding interface, however.

Installing on Mac OS X
======================
A binary is available for Mac OS X. It does not provide the embedding
interface. Simply drag the Veusz application into your Applications
directory.

Veusz can also be installed from source on Mac OS X. The requirements
can be obtained using a system such as MacPorts. You can install them
with MacPorts using:

$ sudo port install qt4-mac
$ sudo port install py-numpy

Once these have successfully built and installed, you can unpack veusz
and install as above.

Qt is available from TrollTech as a binary, but SIP and PyQt are not
available as a binary.
