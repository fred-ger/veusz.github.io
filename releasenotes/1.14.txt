Veusz is a Qt4 based scientific plotting package. It is written in
Python, using PyQt4 for display and user-interfaces, and numpy for
handling the numeric data. Veusz is designed to produce
publication-ready Postscript/PDF/SVG output. The user interface aims
to be simple, consistent and powerful.

Veusz provides a GUI, command line, embedding and scripting interface
(based on Python) to its plotting facilities. It also allows for
manipulation and editing of datasets. Data can be captured from
external sources such as Internet sockets or other programs.

Changes in 1.14:
 * Added interactive tutorial
 * Points in graphs can be colored depending on another dataset and
   the scale shown in a colorbar widget
 * Improved CSV import
    - better data type detection
    - locale-specific numeric and date formats
    - single/multiple/none header modes
    - option to skip lines at top of file
    - better handling of missing values
 * Data can be imported from clipboard
 * Substantially reduced size of output SVG files
 * In standard data import, descriptor can be left blank to generate
   dataset names colX
 * Axis plotting range can be interactively manipulated
 * If axis is in date-time format, show and allow the min and max
   values to be in date-time format
 * ImageFile widget can have image data embedded in document file
 * Fit widget can update the fit parameters and fit quality to a
   label widget
 * Allow editing of 2D datasets in data edit dialog
 * Add copy and paste dataset command to dataset browser context menu

Minor and API changes:
 * Examples added to help menu
 * Picker shows date values as dates
 * Allow descriptor statement in standard data files after a comment
   character, e.g. "#descriptor x y"
 * Added some further color maps
 * Draw key symbols for vector field widget
 * Import plugin changes
    - Register classes rather than instances (backward compatibility
      is retained)
    - Plugins can return constants and functions (see Constant and
      Function types)
    - Add DatasetDateTime for returning date-time datasets
 * Custom definitions
    - Add RemoveCustom API to remove custom definitions
    - AddCustom API can specify order where custom definition is added
 * C++ code to speed up plotting points of different sizes / colors
 * Expand files by default in data navigator window
 * Select created datasets in data edit dialog
 * Tooltip wrapping used in data navigator window
 * Grid lines are dropped if they overlap with edge of graph

Bug fixes
 * Fix initial extension in export dialog
 * Fix crash on hiding pages
 * Fixed validation for numeric values
 * Position of grid lines in perpendicular direction for non default
   positions
 * Catch errors in example import plugin
 * Fix crash for non existent key symbols
 * Fix crash when mismatch of dataset sizes when combining 1D datasets
   to make 2D dataset

Features of package:
 * X-Y plots (with errorbars)
 * Line and function plots
 * Contour plots
 * Images (with colour mappings and colorbars)
 * Stepped plots (for histograms)
 * Bar graphs
 * Vector field plots
 * Box plots
 * Polar plots
 * Ternary plots
 * Plotting dates
 * Fitting functions to data
 * Stacked plots and arrays of plots
 * Plot keys
 * Plot labels
 * Shapes and arrows on plots
 * LaTeX-like formatting for text
 * EPS/PDF/PNG/SVG/EMF export
 * Scripting interface
 * Dataset creation/manipulation
 * Embed Veusz within other programs
 * Text, CSV, FITS, NPY/NPZ, QDP, binary and user-plugin importing
 * Data can be captured from external sources
 * User defined functions, constants and can import external Python functions
 * Plugin interface to allow user to write or load code to
    - import data using new formats
    - make new datasets, optionally linked to existing datasets
    - arbitrarily manipulate the document
 * Data picker
 * Interactive tutorial
 * Multithreaded rendering

Requirements for source install:
 Python (2.4 or greater required)
   http://www.python.org/
 Qt >= 4.4 (free edition)
   http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/  
 PyQt >= 4.3 (SIP is required to be installed first)
   http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/
   http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/sip/
 numpy >= 1.0
   http://numpy.scipy.org/

Optional:
 Microsoft Core Fonts (recommended for nice output)
   http://corefonts.sourceforge.net/
 PyFITS >= 1.1 (optional for FITS import)
   http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/pyfits
 pyemf >= 2.0.0 (optional for EMF export)
   http://pyemf.sourceforge.net/
 PyMinuit >= 1.1.2 (optional improved fitting)
   http://code.google.com/p/pyminuit/
 For EMF and better SVG export, PyQt >= 4.6 or better is
   required, to fix a bug in the C++ wrapping
   

For documentation on using Veusz, see the "Documents" directory. The
manual is in PDF, HTML and text format (generated from docbook). The
examples are also useful documentation. Please also see and contribute
to the Veusz wiki: http://barmag.net/veusz-wiki/

Issues with the current version:

 * Some recent versions of PyQt/SIP will causes crashes when exporting
   SVG files. Update to 4.7.4 (if released) or a recent snapshot to
   solve this problem.
