Veusz 1.18
----------
http://home.gna.org/veusz/

Veusz is a scientific plotting package.  It is designed to produce
publication-ready Postscript/PDF/SVG output. Graphs are built-up by
combining plotting widgets. The user interface aims to be simple,
consistent and powerful.

Veusz provides GUI, Python module, command line, scripting, DBUS and
SAMP interfaces to its plotting facilities. It also allows for
manipulation and editing of datasets. Data can be captured from
external sources such as Internet sockets or other programs.

Changes in 1.18:
 * Add support for dataset expressions when plotting
 * Add axis-function widget for plotting axes which have a scale given
   by a function, or are linked to a different axis via a function
 * Add stepped colour maps
 * Support editing multiple datasets simultaneously in editor
 * Add setting to fix aspect-ratio of graphs
 * Add 'vcentre' line step mode for vertical step plots
 * Add internal margin setting for grids to separate sub-plots
 * Add pixel, pixel_wcs, fraction and linear_wcs FITS import
   coordinate system modes
 * Add drop down toolbar button menu to create axis widgets
 * More efficient widget dependency resolution

Bug fixes:
 * Fix reversed 'broken'-axes
 * Do not always draw axes above other widgets (fixes problem with key
   below axis)
 * Fix use of transparency image when plotting non-square images
 * Allow lists passed as xrange and yrange to create 2D dataset
 * Fix FieldBool positioning for plugins
 * QDP import: fix "no" values when used mixed with numbers
 * Remove warning of log images with zeros
 * For embedded mode, always return string for __repr__
 * Workaround for windows appearing behind for Mac OS X

Features of package:

 Extending:
  * Use as a Python module
  * User defined functions, constants and can import external Python functions
  * Plugin interface to allow user to write or load code to
     - import data using new formats
     - make new datasets, optionally linked to existing datasets
     - arbitrarily manipulate the document
  * Scripting interface
  * Control with DBUS and SAMP
 Other features:

Issues with the current version:

  * Due to a bug in the Qt XML processing, some MathML elements
    containing purely white space (e.g. thin space) will give an error.
