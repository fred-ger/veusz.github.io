Veusz 1.17.1
------------
http://home.gna.org/veusz/

Veusz is a scientific plotting package.  It is designed to produce
publication-ready Postscript/PDF/SVG output. Graphs are built-up by
combining plotting widgets. The user interface aims to be simple,
consistent and powerful.

Veusz provides GUI, Python module, command line, scripting, DBUS and
SAMP interfaces to its plotting facilities. It also allows for
manipulation and editing of datasets. Data can be captured from
external sources such as Internet sockets or other programs.

Changes in 1.17.1:
 * Allow coloured points for non-orthogonal plots (polar, ternary)
 * Remove unnecessary exception data

Bug fixes:
 * Fix Print dialog
 * Fix command-line "Print" command
 * Fix duplicate axes drawn in grid
 * Fix crash adding empty polar plot
 * Exit properly on Mac OS X with --export option
 * Fix highlighted button icons missing (Mac OS X binary)

Changes in 1.17:
 * Add new broken axis widget with gaps in the numerical sequence
 * Grid lines are plotted always under (or over) the data
 * Shift+Scroll wheel scrolls left/right (thanks to Dave Hughes)
 * Polar plots can have a "minimum" radius and log axes
 * Many more LaTeX symbols added
 * Add SAMP/VoTable support (thanks to Graham Bell)
 * New shifted-points xy line mode, which plots a stepped line with
   the points shifted to lie between the coordinates given
 * Points can be picked to console and/or clipboard
   (thanks to Valerio Mussi)
 * Allow reversed ternary plot

Bug fixes:
 * Fix unicode characters for \circ and \odot
 * Fix for data type of pickable points
 * Fix sort by group crash bug
 * Many crashes fixed
 * Fix width of key when using long titles/and or multiple columns
 * Fix bold and italic output in SVG output

     - import data using new formats
     - make new datasets, optionally linked to existing datasets
     - arbitrarily manipulate the document
  * Scripting interface

Issues with the current version:

  * Due to a bug in the Qt XML processing, some MathML elements
    containing purely white space (e.g. thin space) will give an error.
