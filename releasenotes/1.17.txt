Veusz is a Qt4 based scientific plotting package. It is written in
Python, using PyQt4 for display and user-interfaces, and numpy for
handling the numeric data. Veusz is designed to produce
publication-ready Postscript/PDF/SVG output. The user interface aims
to be simple, consistent and powerful.

Veusz provides a GUI, command line, embedding and scripting interface
(based on Python) to its plotting facilities. It also allows for
manipulation and editing of datasets. Data can be captured from
external sources such as Internet sockets or other programs.

Changes in 1.17:
 * Add new broken axis widget with gaps in the numerical sequence
 * Grid lines are plotted always under (or over) the data
 * Shift+Scroll wheel scrolls left/right (thanks to Dave Hughes)
 * Polar plots can have a "minimum" radius and log axes
 * Many more LaTeX symbols added
 * Add SAMP/VoTable support (thanks to Graham Bell)
 * New shifted-points xy line mode, which plots a stepped line with
   the points shifted to lie between the coordinates given
 * Points can be picked to console and/or clipboard
   (thanks to Valerio Mussi)
 * Allow reversed ternary plot

Bug fixes:
 * Fix unicode characters for \circ and \odot
 * Fix for data type of pickable points
 * Fix sort by group crash bug
 * Many crashes fixed
 * Fix width of key when using long titles/and or multiple columns
 * Fix bold and italic output in SVG output

Features of package:
 * X-Y plots (with errorbars)
 * Line and function plots
 * Contour plots
 * Images (with colour mappings and colorbars)
 * Stepped plots (for histograms)
 * Bar graphs
 * Vector field plots
 * Box plots
 * Polar plots
 * Ternary plots
 * Plotting dates
 * Fitting functions to data
 * Stacked plots and arrays of plots
 * Plot keys
 * Plot labels
 * Shapes and arrows on plots
 * LaTeX-like formatting for text
 * EPS/PDF/PNG/SVG/EMF export
 * Scripting interface
 * Dataset creation/manipulation
 * Embed Veusz within other programs
 * Text, CSV, FITS, NPY/NPZ, QDP, binary and user-plugin importing
 * Data can be captured from external sources
 * User defined functions, constants and can import external Python functions
 * Plugin interface to allow user to write or load code to
    - import data using new formats
    - make new datasets, optionally linked to existing datasets
    - arbitrarily manipulate the document
 * Data picker
 * Interactive tutorial
 * Multithreaded rendering

For documentation on using Veusz, see the "Documents" directory. The
manual is in PDF, HTML and text format (generated from docbook). The
examples are also useful documentation. Please also see and contribute
to the Veusz wiki: http://barmag.net/veusz-wiki/

Issues with the current version:

  * Due to a bug in the Qt XML processing, some MathML elements
    containing purely white space (e.g. thin space) will give an error.
